RC_Car
======

The code used on an atmega1284 microcontroller to control my remote control car. The android app I used to control my RC car is the Arduino Bluetooth RC Car on google playstore. It can be found here: (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&hl=en).
